# Roam-Templates

As a programmer, anything that I don't want to do I will try to automate. Every day, when I open Roam the first time, I have to copy a template into my daily notes page. This takes a grand total of 2 seconds, but it's 2 seconds I don't want to spend. 

1. Setup the chrome extension 
2. Open your template file 
3. Select all the text you want to save as your template
4. Click the chrome extension icon (you will see an alert appear)
5. Now every time you open the page with your daily notes it will be auto filled with the template 

I just finished this, may clean it up and add docs later... have fun.
